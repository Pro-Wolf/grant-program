### Overview

**Project Description:**

The L1 Blockchain Network Monitoring Solution project is a comprehensive endeavor to develop an open-source monitoring tool that will serve as a vital asset to any L1 blockchain infrastructure. The goal is to offer real-time insights, proactive alerting, and in-depth analytics, ensuring the seamless performance and robust security of blockchain networks.
The project proposes to leverage an open-source stack, combining cutting-edge technologies to create a user-friendly, one-click solution for monitoring L1 blockchain networks. The system will focus on tracking and analyzing key metrics associated with blockchain validators, providing a comprehensive view of the network's health and performance.

**Proposal Overview**

Our team proposes to leverage an open-source stack to create a one-click solution for network monitoring. 
This solution will monitor the blockchain validator, tracking various metrics and generating alerts if there are any issues with the running validator.

### Project Details

**Key Features**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Our solution will provide real-time monitoring of L1 blockchain networks, tracking key metrics such as block propagation time, checkpoint signing and proposals and attestations.
2. **Validator Monitoring**: We will monitor the performance and status of blockchain validators, ensuring they are functioning correctly and efficiently.
3. **Proactive Alerting**: Our solution will generate alerts based on predefined criteria. If there are any issues with the running validator or any unusual network activity, the Validator owner will be notified immediately.
4. **Grafana Dashboards**: We will provide Grafana dashboards for visualizing network performance data. These dashboards will be customizable to specific needs and will provide a clear, intuitive interface for understanding network status and performance.
5. **Scalability**: Our solution is designed to scale with the network, ensuring that as the blockchain grows, our monitoring capabilities will grow with it.

**Benefits to the Network Foundation** 

1. **Improved Network Performance**: By monitoring the network in real-time, we can identify and address issues before they impact network performance. When all validator onboarded on the monitoring solution, we can have network wide in depth monitoring.
2. **Enhanced Security**: Our proactive alerting system will help identify and respond to potential security threats more quickly.
3. **Greater Visibility**: With our Grafana dashboards, the Network Foundation will have a clear, visual representation of network performance, helping make data-driven decisions.
4. **Cost Savings**: By leveraging open-source technologies, we can provide a robust, feature-rich solution at a fraction of the cost of proprietary solutions.

### Team members

- Name of team leader - Mohak Agarwal
- Names of team members - Apoorv Raj Saxena, Prosenjit Mukherjee

### Team Website

### Team's experience

In terms of prioir work, Mohak Agarwal has built ClayStack, which is a liquid staking protocol and has 3 public audits(without even any medium severity bugs).
However, the team at WolfEdge is completely separate than ClayStack, but both are under his leadership with a combined experience of more than 20 years in the sector.
At WolfEdge labs, we have built a lot of stuff internally and have helped various L1s but now we want to build open source products. This would be our first open source grant and hence in the proposal we haven’t put any upfront payment, rather the first payment after a substantial milestone.
